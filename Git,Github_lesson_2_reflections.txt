Git commands

1) git init to create a new git repository


2) git status to check the status of the repository


3) git add to add the file to the staging area


3) git commit to create a commit 


Reflections

1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?




2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
