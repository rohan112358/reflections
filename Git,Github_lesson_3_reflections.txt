2) git push origin thread name  
transfer from (to) the local repository (on one's computer) to (from) the Github repository occurs in the form of commits being pushed to (pulled from/ fetched from) the Github repository. Instead of pushing (pulling) commits individually, one can push the thread, which will automatically push all the commits belonging to the thread. For the later instances of pushing this thread, only the newer commits are added

Instructions

Github password caching
 If you're cloning GitHub repositories using HTTPS, you can use a credential helper to tell Git to remember your GitHub username and password every time it talks to GitHub. Turn on the credential helper so that Git will save your password in memory for some time

 git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
 # Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds). default timeout is 15 min when not explicitly specified
